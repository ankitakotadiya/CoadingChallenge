'''
Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.
A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9]
'''

'''
# Set middle element of the array as root.
# Recursively do the same for left half and right half.
# Get middle element of the left half and set left child of the root that we have created first.
# Same get middle element of right half and set right child of the root.
# Follow the same process until array is non-empty.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
